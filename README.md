## üìñ About
Encrypton is a string encryption project for Java. Encrypton uses configurable encryptions that work in algorithimic ways to encrypt strings.
It also makes it possible to layer these configurable encryptions, making strings encrypted even harder to decrypt.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage
Encrypton is great for complex configurable layered encryptions. Encrypton is also easily extensible so new configurable encryption algorithims can be easily made.
Encrypton can also have encryptions be configured randomly, making it good for encrypting similar data many times.
Encrypton comes with a very simple registry for encryptions, making serializing and deserializing encryptions easier.
